Cyrillic keyboard
=================

For particular reason I don't like to look at *that* flag anymore.
So I hacked my keyboard layout, changed it's name, flag and
added missing Ukrainian-Cyrillic letters to it.

UPD: Added a version of standard "Cyrillic phonetic" keybord layout with a better flag.

How to use
----------

Copy 'Cyrillic bilingual.bundle' into /Library/Keyboard\\ Layouts
and go to language preferences.

Ukrainian-cyrillic keys:

- `alt-и` or `alt-і` for і
- `alt-й` or `alt-§` or `alt-ї` for ї
- `alt-э` є
- `alt-г` for ґ

Bonus keys:

- alt-е
- alt-ц
